<h1>Unit 1: The Basics of the Web</h1>

<b>What does it consist of?</b>
<p>The web consists of HTML, URL's, HTTP, and Web Applications that all interact with each other to create a systematic every-day internet. </p>

<b>The World Wide Web</b>
<br>

<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Lanugage. To link pages, you use something called a hyperlink, and the internet has more than 30 billion webpages. Request from pages are made from your computer to servers by the protocol of HTTP, which is why we see that at the beginning of any link to any website. HTML is made up of text contet, markup, images, videos, and links to other pages.
</p>
<br>
<b>Tag Content and Examples</b>
<br>
<p>Tags look like this: <(Name of Tag)> Contents <(Name of Tag)>
  <br>
  Some examples are: The tag b provides bold letters. The tag em makes letters appear in italics. Links are defined using the (a) anchor tag, using href as an attribute. The images tag is img, the p tag is the paragraph tag, and the br tag is the "line break" tag, which is used to separate two lines when needed. Tags are also known as inline, or block. Block tags put an "invisible box" around your text.</p>
  <b>HTML Structure</b>
  <br>
  <p>HTML starts with a doctype, followed by the html tag which surrounds the document, the head and other meta-data, and last but not least comes the body tag. Overall, HTML has a very organized and neat structure, making it easy to learn for many people.</p>
